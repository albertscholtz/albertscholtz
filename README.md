👋 Hi, I’m @albertscholtz. Good to see you!

☕ I believe code has the power to make a real change in the world!

👀 I’m interested in any programming language, but mostly active in the Kotlin and Java ecosystem.

🚀 I’m currently learning flutter and hopefully soon starting some CEH training. Big fan of JetBrains Academy, my profile is [here](https://hyperskill.org/profile/257286230) ⚔️

❤️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source project that makes a positive impact.

🇿🇦 I'm proud and honoured to be employed at [OneSpark](https://onespark.co.za/ "OneSpark"), a proudly South African company.
