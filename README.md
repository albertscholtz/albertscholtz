👋 Hi, I’m @albertscholtz. Good to see you!

☕ I believe code has the power to make a real change in the world!

👀 I’m interested in any programming language, but mostly active in the Java ecosystem.

🚀 I’m currently learning flutter and hopefully soon starting some CEH training ⚔️

❤️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source project that makes a positive impact.
